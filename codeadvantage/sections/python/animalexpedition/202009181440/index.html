<h3 id="lesson1_hw">Homework</h3>
<h4>Part 1</h4>
<h5>Please do this!</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Install Python 3 on your computer. This <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download">guide</a> may be helpful.</li>
    <li>Create a folder in which to store this class's projects.</li>
    <li>Load up IDLE, Python's built-in editor (or your preferred code editor), and copy the code from class (linked above) to a .py file in that folder.</li>
    <li>Save it and run it to make sure everything is working.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Part 2</h4>
<p>Using what we did in class as a jumping-off point, create a simple Turtle program where you can move the turtle around using the arrow keys or WASD.</p>
<p>The function to take key presses as input is <code>screen.onkeypress(func, key)</code>.</p>
<p>Arrow keys are strings "Left", "Right", "Up", and "Down".</p>
<p>There are many ways to move the turtle. For example, you can use <code>t.goto(x,y)</code>, <code>t.setpos(x,y)</code>, <code>t.forward/backward(x,y)</code>, and <code>t.left/right(deg)</code>.</p>
<p>Try writing your own function to get the turtle to move around in more complex ways, or even draw a shape when you right-click (button 2).</p>
<p>If you get stuck or you don't know how to do something, consult the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html">Turtle library documentation</a>!</p>

<h2 id="lesson2">Lesson 2 | Sep. 25</h2>
<h3 id="lesson2_code">Code</h3>
<ul><li><a href="https://repl.it/@gschare/animalexpeditionweek2">main.py -- animation loops</a></li></ul>

<h3 id="lesson2_hw">Homework</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Familiarize yourself with the game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">Snake</a>.</li>
    <li>Play Snake for a little bit. You can find it by typing "snake" into Google.</li>
    <li>Make a list of "game elements" that we will have to code. For example, the snake itself, the score, the food, the movement, how you can lose the game...</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lesson3">Lesson 3 | Oct. 2</h2>
<h3 id="lesson3_code">Code</h3>
<ul><li><a href="week3.py">week3.py -- creating and moving along a grid</a></li></ul>

<h3 id="lesson3_hw">Homework</h3>
<p>For the following exercises, you can try writing code or just plan it out on paper!</p>
<ul>
    <li>Devise a way to spawn the food, for the snake to eat it, and for it to reappear somewhere else on the screen.</li>
    <li>Devise a way to draw the snake's tail following it along its path.</li>
    <li>Devise a way to check for collisions with the wall or with your own tail.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's okay if you get stuck! I just want you to get thinking about how to implement these aspects of the game.</p>
<p>This is more about designing than worrying about exactly how to code it.</p>
