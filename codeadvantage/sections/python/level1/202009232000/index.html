<p>Do whichever of these exercises seem interesting to you! I encourage you to follow your curiosity on whatever gets you excited.</p>

<p>Don't feel pressure to do all of them! These are really just ideas to get your programming muscles going, and to give you stuff to practice with in between classes.</p>

<h4>I. Input and Output basics</h4>

<ol>
<li>Print a sentence of your choice with <code>print()</code>.</li>
<li>Ask the user to input a sentence and then repeat it back to the user with an exclamation point at the end.</li>
<li>Use the special <code>"\n"</code> string to print a new line in the middle of a sentence. I won't tell you exactly how to do this -- it's up to you to experiment with it!</li>
<li>Once you understand <code>"\n"</code>, try <code>"\t"</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>II. Personality Quiz</h4>

<p>Expand on the small personality quiz we did in class. Collect answers to a bunch of questions and then list them out in whatever way you like. Then force your captive family members to take the quiz.</p>

<h4>III. Mad Libs</h4>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs">Mad Libs</a> is a game where one player asks the other for a series of parts of speech (e.g. "noun", "verb in past tense", "person's name") and uses those answers to fill in the blanks to a story that the other player doesn't see. Then, the story is read aloud and it should be completely absurd because the player providing the answers had no clue how the words would fit into the story.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can see how what we learned in class is perfectly suited to this kind of game.</p>

<p><li>Write your own story, or find one online, in the REPL editor as a string, leaving plenty of blanks for variables. Ask the user for input, prompting them like the player asking for parts of speech would. Store these answers and use them to fill in the blanks of the story.</li></p>

<p>It's important that the string comes <em>after</em> the answers are collected, or else the variables representing the answers won't be defined and the program will break!</p>

<h4>IV. Casting</h4>

<p><em>Note</em>: decimal values are called <code>float</code>s in Python. Floats, just like ints, have a function for converting a value. For ints, this is <code>int()</code>, and appropriately for floats, this is <code>float()</code>.</p>

<p>There is also one for strings: <code>str()</code>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Store various data types in different variables and try converting between them.</li>
<li>Record what happens. Do any conversions cause errors? Look for strange edge cases.</li>
<li>What happens when you convert a float to an int?</li>
</ol>

<h4>V. Cashier</h4>

<p>Write a program called <b>cashier.py</b> that does the following:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Ask user for an amount of money (the change owed) as input. This should be in the form "3.92" to represent 3 dollars and 92 cents. Hint: what data type is this? You will need to cast it to that data type, because <code>input()</code> always gives you a string.</li>
    <li>Convert this amount to pennies by multiplying by 100.</li>
    <li>Starting with dollars, then quarters, and so on to pennies, compute the fewest number of coins necessary to fill the given amount. For example, 3.92 cents is most efficiently broken up into 3 dollars, 3 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies.</li>
    <li>Print out how many of each coin is required to give the user their change.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will have to use a variable for each of the coins to store how many of them are needed.</p>

<p>To make this work, you will need one more operator we didn't learn about in class: the modulus operator, written in Python as <code>%</code>. This is actually simpler than it seems; it just returns the remainder of the division of two numbers. For example, <code>9 % 2 = 1</code> and <code>10 % 5 = 0</code> and <code>92 % 25 = 17</code>.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<h4>Fibonacci sequence</h4>
<p>In mathematics, there is something called the <b>Fibonacci sequence</b>, which is a special sequence of numbers defined as follows:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>F<sub>0</sub> = 0
F<sub>1</sub> = 1
F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub></code></pre>
<br>
<p>Okay... but what the heck does that mean?!</p>
<br>

<p>It's actually pretty simple. The Fibonacci sequence is just where you count by adding the two previous numbers in the list together to get the next one. For this to make sense, we need to start with two numbers already, so we say the first two numbers are 0 and 1.</p>

<br>

<p>Let's see an example.</p>
<br>

<pre><code>First two numbers: 0, 1.
Next: 0 + 1 = 1.
Next: 1 + 1 = 2.
Next: 1 + 2 = 3.
Next: 2 + 3 = 5.
Next: 3 + 5 = 8.
Next: 5 + 8 = 13.
Next: 8 + 13 = 21.
</code></pre>
<br>
<p>...and so on. As you see, it actually makes a lot of sense! So the sequence so far can be written as:</p>
<br>
<pre><code>0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...</code></pre>
<br>
<p>Like many sequences, it goes on forever. It turns out that a lot of things in nature adhere to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, there's a famous thing called the <em>Fibonacci spiral</em> (pictured below) which you can find all throughout biology and art as it is very satisfying to look at.</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="FibonacciSpiral.svg" alt="Fibonacci spiral">
</div>

<br>

<p>There's another kind of Fibonacci spiral, which instead of making squares out of the numbers of the sequence like above, counts the number of outward spirals of a sunflower plant, which happens to perfectly match the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="SunflowerModel.svg" alt="Sunflower spiral"> 
</div>

<br>

<p>A similar idea appears in other plants. Here is an overlay of the Fibonacci sequence over a chamomile flower, demonstrating another one of these appearances in nature.</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="FibonacciChamomile.png" alt="Fibonacci chamomile">
</div>

<br>

<p>For this exercise, the user will enter a number and you will then calculate and print that many numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.</p>

<h5>The Exercise</h5>

<p>Do the following in Python:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Get an integer from the user and store it. Let's call this <code>n</code></li>
    <li>Set two variables to represent the last two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. They should start as 0 and 1.</li>
    <li>Use a while loop to repeatedly print the next number in the Fibonacci sequence until you've computed <code>n</code> Fibonacci numbers.</li>
        <ul><li>Consider: instead of adding 1 to a <code>counter</code> variable like we did in class, can you <em>subtract</em> 1 from <code>n</code> until you reach 0?</li></ul>
</ol>

<br>

<p>Remember: this exercise is meant to be very challenging. That being said, I don't want you stress over it! Looking stuff up on the internet is not only allowed&mdash;it's encouraged! Googling stuff to help you with a problem is a really useful skill, in programming and for life in general. If you get stuck, seeking help online is a perfectly valid strategy.</p>
