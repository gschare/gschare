Pseudocode
Pseudo- means not quite, or pretending
Pseudointellectual = someone who poses or pretends to be smart

Pseudocode = pretending to be code. looks like code but isn't

Python code:
num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(num1 + num2)

Pseudocode:
1. Get an integer from the user and store it as "num1".
2. Get another integer from the user and store it as "num2".
3. Add num1 and num2 and print the result.

algorithm = the set of instructions for the computer to follow. AKA "the program".

Write a program in pseudocode for counting from 1 to 100.

Option 1
1. Set a variable number = 1
2. Set a variable number2 = 2
...
100. Set a variable num100 = 100
101. print(number1)
...
200. print(number100)

Option 2
1. Set a variable which is a list of numbers 1-100
2. Print(each number with \n between them)

Option 3
1. Set count = 1
2. print(count)
3. count = count + 1
4. Repeat from step 2 until count is 100

Option 3.5
1. Set count = 1
2. Do the following while count is less than or equal to 100:
	3. print(count)
	4. count = count + 1

Example of a repeating algorithm on a shampoo bottle:
1. wet hair
2. lather
3. rinse
4. repeat
