            <p>There's no content on this website (yet). Not for most people, anyway.</p>
            <p>If you happen to be one of my students, however, feel free to head on over to the <a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a> page, where you'll find course pages for my summer and fall 2020 CodeAdvantage classes. If you do, please feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:g.schare@columbia.edu">g.schare@columbia.edu</a> and let me know what cool stuff you've been up to!</p>
            <p>The About page doesn't exist yet. Don't click it. It will lead you nowhere. Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
            <p>My GitHub link, on the other hand, <em>does</em> exist. Check that out if you're interested in my work on the <a href="https://makingandknowing.org">Making and Knowing Project</a>, <a href="https://columbiaspace.org">Columbia Space Initiative</a>, or <a href="https://gallformers.org">Gallformers</a>.</p>
