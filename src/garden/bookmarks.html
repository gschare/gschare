            <p>A proposal, dear reader: Create a list of bookmarks linking to
            websites you find interesting, and publish it for the world to see.
            You decide what constitutes "interesting".</p>

            <p> The model is as recursive as it is simple. There is nothing
            preventing a list of bookmarks from linking to another list of
            bookmarks.  </p>

            <p> The creation of a bookmark list is a surprisingly fun project,
            it has some of the appeal of scrapbooking; and the end-result is
            also appealing to browse through.  </p>

            <p> It's a bit strange, almost nobody seems to be doing this.
            Looking through a sample of personal websites, very few of them has
            links to other personal websites. A hyperlink isn't a marriage
            proposal. It is enough to find some redeeming quality in a website
            to link to it. It costs nothing, and helps bring traffic to pages
            that you yourself think deserve it.</p>
