    <h1>Cultivation</h1>

        Digital gardening is a dual metaphor.
    </p>
    <p>
        At once, it evokes a <i>garden</i>, a place of peace and contemplation
        without the expectation for perfection, and it evokes <i>gardening</i>,
        a process involved in the maintenance and cultivation of a garden.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence digital gardening implies a process, not just an object or a
        place or a result. For me, the process comes first and the object grows
        naturally as a result&mdash;or perhaps side-effect. Contrast this with
        a blog, in which the focus is on the result&mdash;the <i>blog
            post</i>&mdash;while the process is a means to this end. (Though we
        hope that the blog author enjoys the process as well, or it may not be
        sustainable!)
    </p>

        This is a hobby. A small pleasure. Gardening is something that happens
        when the urge comes to you, or when weeds need weeding. In digital
        spaces, to garden often involves maintaining small corners of our
        digital lives, like our websites, notes and files, photo libraries,
        pieces of personal software, and social media profiles.

        Gardening invokes many verbs: pruning, improving, planting,
        transplanting, moving, harvesting, expanding, contracting, gathering,
        <i>cultivating</i>. In software, one may tweak, tinker, design, develop,
        refactor, implement, <i>maintain</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Digital gardening, then, is the maintenance and cultivation of
        digital gardens. But I prefer to flip this relationship and 
        define the result in terms of the process that creates it:
    </p>

    <b>Def:</b> A <u>digital garden</u> is the side-effect resulting from the
    processes of maintenance and cultivation involved in digital gardening.
