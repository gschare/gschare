<h2 id="report">Incident Report</h2>
<p>Two officers responded to 911 call originating from landline at Cal Wok
Chinese Restaurant at 7:38 PM. Tom Henker, 45, resident of Manzanita County,
reported feeling normal when officers arrived and appears healthy following
incident. No foul play suspected (see below). Restaurant temporarily closed
pending food safety inspection. Mr. Henker referred to psychological services
for treatment for possible stress disorder.</p>
<p>Caller (Mr. Jun Li) reported seeing Mr. Henker choking suddenly.
Caller was at dinner with Mr. Henker on a business trip, along with two
colleagues and one colleague of Mr. Henker from the Pauling Tractor Company. Bystanders reported Mr. Henker began to choke and
signal for help.</p>
<p>Quote transcribed from audio recording of questioning Mr. Henker
following incident:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was like all the air in my lungs just disappeared and there was
nothing for me to breathe. It was strange. I wasn’t even eating at the
time - I didn’t choke on anything. I was in the middle of talking to Jun
and Franklin about the merger and then all the air around me was gone.
Then it was over and I could breathe again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Officers responding at the scene asked Mr. Henker about his personal
history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, well, I suppose I’ve been stressed about the acquisition but this
has never happened before. I’ve been to this restaurant 6,022,140 times.
[inaudible] What? Sorry, did I say that? I meant dozens of times.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ongoing investigation into existence of <a
href="coroner.html">coroner’s report</a> of Mr. Henker’s body, dated
Sunday, October 29th, 2000. During preliminary inspection, document
appears to be genuine and not a forgery. Pauling General Hospital
coroner reports no memory of performing an autopsy. Document currently
under federal government seizure.</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>SCIENC dispatched a technical team to the scene to conduct an
analysis of the phenomenon. They found abnormal spikes in the vorticity
of the room’s air, indicating a possible flux anomaly.</p>
