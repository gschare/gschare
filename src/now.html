            Seventh (and final?) semester of undergrad. I am loaded up with classes, so I
            don't have much time for research and personal projects.
            Instead, my focus is on my coursework:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Learning language design in a seminar with <a
                href="https://www.stroustrup.com/">Bjarne Stroustrup</a></li>
            <li>Working as a teaching assistant for both formal
                verification and parallel functional programming</li>
            <li>Studying point-set topology and algebraic topology at the same time,
                for some reason</li>
            <li>And a few classes for fun and core requirements: fiction
                writing, Judaism and Israeli cinema</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            It's a busy schedule, but quite exhilarating.
            Today I led our language design seminar in a discussion of <a
                href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/234286.1057828">Alan Kay's
                HOPL paper on Smalltalk</a>&mdash;a paper which led to some
            powerful epiphanies about object-oriented design, end-user
            programming, and computer science education.

            I've found the time to binge-watch the first two seasons of <i>Community</i>.
            It seems everyone has seen it already, but this party is so great I
            have no qualms being late to it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Plans on the horizon: a couple of trips around
        the Northeast, including <a
            href="https://www.njpls.org/nov2023.html">NJPLS</a>; grad school
        applications; graduation; seeing my dogs back home.
