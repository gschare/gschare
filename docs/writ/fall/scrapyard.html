<h1>Interrogation of Dr. Dugme</h1>

<p><strong>Item:</strong> interrogation (transcript)<br />
<strong>Date:</strong> 11/1/2000<br />
<strong>Archived:</strong> 11/1/2000<br />
<strong>Subject(s):</strong> Dr. Goran Dugme</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Dr. Goran Dugme was arrested by the police on Wednesday, November 1st
on suspicion of DUI. By this time, Dugme had already spoken with the
police about the possibly ersatz <a href="coroner.html">autopsy
report</a> but he was let go without suspicion because the document was
shown to be genuine. On Wednesday morning, SCIENC seized the autopsy
document from Pauling PD’s forensics.</p>
<p>Pauling PD arrested Dugme on Wednesday afternoon. We now understand
this to be in response to a Pauling PD officer’s report of a traffic
stop escapee matching his description, though no record of the traffic
stop could be found. The officer claimed to have pursued a suspect in
Dugme’s vehicle along Highway 8. The officer had difficulty recalling
whether or not he tested Dugme for alcohol; his recollection overall was
hazy at best. Nevertheless, possibly in reaction to increasing tensions
with SCIENC’s presence in Pauling, the department took this seriously
and had Dugme in custody at the precinct Wednesday evening. SCIENC took
Dugme into custody late Wednesday evening after Pauling PD was unable to
prove the legality of the arrest.</p>
<h2 id="transcript">Transcript</h2>
<p>SCIENC: Please state your name.</p>
<p>GD: Goran Dugme.</p>
<p>SCIENC: How do you spell that?</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>SCIENC: Can you tell us what you did on Sunday night?</p>
<p>GD: Is this going on my record?</p>
<p>SCIENC: You have complete confidentiality here. You are not under
arrest.</p>
<p>GD: …</p>
<p>[Dugme remained silent for several minutes.]</p>
<p>SCIENC: Can you tell us what you did on Sunday night?</p>
<p>GD: I don’t think you’ll believe me.</p>
<p>SCIENC: …</p>
<p>GD: I don’t usually drink on Sundays.</p>
<p>[Dugme remained silent for one minute.]</p>
<p>GD: I wasn’t called in to the morgue that night. I had the day to
myself. And in the evening, well, I like to go the scrapyard.</p>
<p>SCIENC: Pauling Scrapyard and Metal Reclamation, is that correct?</p>
<p>GD: Yes.</p>
<p>SCIENC: Why the scrapyard?</p>
<p>GD: I don’t know. I just walk around there.</p>
<p>SCIENC: Did you drive to the scrapyard?</p>
<p>GD: Yes. And I walk around there. It was a clear night. I was looking
at the moon.</p>
<p>SCIENC: Were you alone?</p>
<p>GD: Well. I was alone. And then I heard a voice. But not from in the
scrapyard. It was…</p>
<p>[Dugme remained silent for one minute.]</p>
<p>GD: I heard it in my head. Like a thought. But really clear. But it
wasn’t mine. I looked around, and it became clearer. It was sort of
telling me where to go. And I went around a corner and I saw. [He
laughs.] I saw a brain.</p>
<p>SCIENC: A brain?</p>
<p>GD: Yeah, a floating brain. Like big. Bigger than a human brain. But
it looked like one. And parts of a spinal cord.</p>
<p>SCIENC: It was floating?</p>
<p>GD: Yeah and–</p>
<p>SCIENC: How was it floating?</p>
<p>GD: I don’t know. Like a foot higher than me off the ground. But it
talked to me. I remember this, because it was in my head. It said,</p>
