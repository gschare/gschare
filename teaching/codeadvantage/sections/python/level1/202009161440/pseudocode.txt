Write a program in pseudocode explaining how to count from 1 to 100. Just like in Exercise 1, it's important to be specific!

option 1:
1. Count to 100

option 2:
1. Start at a number, 1 (set variable number=1)
2. If number isn't 100, then say the number, otherwise, stop
3. Set number equal to previous number + 1
4. Repeat from step 2

option 2.5:
1. Set number = 1
2. Do the following forever:
  3. If number isn't 100, then say the number, otherwise, stop
  4. Set number equal to previous number + 1

New ideas from this pseudocode:
If/otherwise: conditional
Repeat: loop

option 3:
1. say 1
2. say 2
3. say 3
4. say 4
5. say 5
6. say 6
TERRIBLE. Why? If you decide you want to count to 1000 instead, it takes 900 more lines.
