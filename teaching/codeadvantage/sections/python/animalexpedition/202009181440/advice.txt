Python is a wonderful language, but it's not super great for making games.
Instead, people typically use one of the following:
- C# and Java
  - two very similar Object-Oriented languages
  - C# used by Unity
  - Java used for Android mobile app development
- C++
  - more difficult Object-Oriented and imperative language
  - often used to program renderers and game engines
- JavaScript
  - very similar to Python (not related to Java!)
  - the main language for web coding that all browsers use
  - how to make a JavaScript game that runs in the browser:
    - make a folder on your computer
    - put a file called index.html and put in the bare mininum document tags and a script tag
    - put a file called app.js/sketch.js/script.js and load that into the html
    - code your game in that .js file
    - open the html file in your browser

    Developer's Toolkit, by Rex van der Spuy
- Lua
  - very intuitive language specifically made for making games

Software and Frameworks for making games:
- Unity: game design software w/ some coding in C#
- Godot: another software like Unity, maybe a bit easier learning curve
- GameMaker: more user-friendly software
- OpenGL (Open Graphics Library): API (Application Programming Interface)
  for rendering graphics
  - essentially you can load this API into almost any language and gain
    access to lots of game-making utilities. Good if you don't want to use a
    software interface and just focus on coding.
- Processing: (Java, Python, or JS) for animation, graphics, art

Mobile App Development
 - Apple apps are coded in XCode
 - Android apps are coded in Java

How do you find resources for learning?
- formal online courses, e.g. MOOCs (Massively Open Online Courses)
  - EdX
  - Coursera
- search YouTube or Google
  - e.g. "how to make a game using JavaScript canvas"
  - look for in-depth tutorial series
- get a book (physical or PDF)
  - from the library, from the internet, from an online bookstore

Book recommendations (but do look for your own!):
- The Advanced Game Developer's Toolkit (Javascript and HTML web-based game handbook) by Rex van der Spuy
- Game Programming Patterns by Robert Nystrom
