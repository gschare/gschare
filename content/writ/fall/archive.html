<p>Dear Analyst,</p>
<p>The October 29th Pauling Incident (codename: Fall Break) has
motivated the formation of an incident response team made up of members
of the Special Committee for the Investigation into the Evolution of
Natural Constants (SCIENC).</p>
<p>The following is a short brief written to acquaint you with the
situation and what we need from you.</p>
<p>Starting on October 31st, 2000, the Fall Break Archive Team has
assembled documents from during and after the incident in an attempt to
piece together the answer to our most pressing question.</p>
<p>We know that the cause of the incident was an officially unrecognized
particle collision experiment at the Pauling Power Plant (internally
known as the Pauling Quantum Energy Research Center). According to the
supervising director, the experiment resulted in the creation of a
miniature black hole. The experiment was swiftly aborted and the black
hole evaporated, but between the 11:15 AM on October 29th and 11:42 AM
the following morning, for 24 hours and 27 minutes, the townspeople of
Pauling reported multiple phenomena consistent with a localized
spacetime fracture (technically, a Hilbert Superposition). Please see
our <a href="experiment.html">incident overview report and analysis</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>What we do not know at this time, and what we need your help in
discerning, is what caused the phenomena to abruptly cease at 11:42 AM
on October 30th. To help you deduce the answer to this question, we are
providing you with partial access to the archived materials. We are
unable to permit you full access due to security policies at SCIENC.</p>
<p>To get started, have a look at these cases, and go from there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tom.html">The Case of Tom Henker</a></li>
<li><a href="picnic.html">The Case of Marcia’s Picnic</a></li>
<li><a href="ayahuasca.html">The Case of the Ayahuasca Support
Group</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the documents assembled in this archive exhibit
numerous factual inconsistencies, but in most cases, we have found no
evidence of willful deception or manipulation. We believe that on
October 29th, reality split into an unknown number of parallel
timelines, and when they recombined on the morning of October 30th, our
reality became something resembling a weighted random sample of events
across the whole distribution of possible universes. That is to say, if
you went out for milk in half of the realities and stayed home in the
other half, you might remember staying home and yet a fresh carton of
milk appears in your fridge.</p>
<p>When you have an answer, write it below.</p>

<form>
<label for="answer">Who reunited the parallel realities into one?</label><br>
<input id="answer" type="text">
</form>

<p>We at SCIENC value your cooperation and discretion.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
