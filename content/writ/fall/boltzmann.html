<h1>Boltzmann Brain</h1>
<p><em>by Prof. Mueller</em></p>
<p>Boltzmann argued the following: over a sufficiently long time, random fluxuations in even very low
energy particles could result in the spontaneous formation of complex
structures.</p>
<p>Think of it like this. When we see shapes in clouds, there is no
structured process giving them form. It is only the random, turbulent
mixing of air and water at altitude. But as clouds form all of the world
all day every day, would it be so surprising to imagine that once every
now and then, by sheer random chance, a cloud forms a near-perfect image
of your own face? What then, if its lips moved like yours do, albeit
through coincidence and not intention? What if it appeared to speak
silent words of wisdom?</p>
<p>A complex pattern is complex regardless of its origins. Meaning is
something we perceive, not an inherent property that hides as
metaphysical truth behind the look of things. The appearance of a mind,
given sufficient complexity, is indistinguishable from a “real”, evolved
mind. That is the Boltzmann brain.</p>
