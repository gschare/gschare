<p><strong>Item:</strong> coroner's report (transcript)<br />

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p>Subject is 45 year old male, admitted dead on arrival to Pauling
General Hospital. Presiding physician Dr. Dugme.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Evidence of death by asphyxiation. Surface ecchymosis consistent with
hypothesis. No sign of strangulation. Airways intact.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Making thoracic incision…</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Both lungs appear to have collapsed instantly. Checking history…
subject has no history of lung disease, smoking, or pneumothorax.
Subject is 5’7”; structural failure is unlikely to be correlated.</p>
<p>Cause of death concluded to be hypoxia.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>The apparent subject, Mr. Tom Henker, is known to be alive at the
time of writing. The relevant <a href="tom.html">police incident
report</a> describes him choking in a restaurant and recovering
completely.</p>
<p>Dr. Dugme was brought in and questioned about this report. He claims
no memory of performing any autopsies on October 29th, and has never
admitted a man under the name of Henker. Beyond this he was unwilling to
cooperate. Other documents place him near <a
href="scrapyard.html">Pauling Scrapyard and Metal Reclamation</a> on the
evening of October 29th.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Mueller:</strong> these findings are consistent with
sudden localized air decompression. My prevailing theory? There was a
sudden, instaneous perturbation in the molecular pressure flux that
snowballed into a curl reversal at the vortical singularity located,
unfortunately, in Mr. Henker’s body. The resulting change in the
diffusion coefficient caused all of the air in his lungs to evacuate
instantly. The measurements taken at the restaurant show that indeed
Gaussian law was conserved and the ambient turbulent flow exhibited a
significantly higher kinetic energy than would be expected from a
typical room like that. While this theory hinges on the occurrence of an
event that is astronomically unlikely - my assistant estimated 1 in
about 6 million - it is by all means physically possible. We work with
the information we have, and accept the conclusions that arise, however
improbable - or disconcerting - they may be. I wish I could be more
confident in my answer. If only we had been there with the necessary
equipment when it happened…</p>
