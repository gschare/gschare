<h1>The Case of the Ayahuasca Support Group</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The following memos were printed and pinned to the bulletin board in
the Pauling Episcopalian Church where the Ayahuasca Support Group meets
weekly on Sundays following mass. They were posted at separate times. We
have done our best to list them in the order we believe they were
posted.</p>
<h2 id="initial-memo">Initial Memo</h2>
<p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>I just wanted to address some concerns that were brought to me
privately regarding our meeting earlier today. First, while this is a
safe space for discussing our honest and real feelings about our
relationship to psychoactive substances, it is <em>absolutely
inappropriate</em> to encourage your peers to abuse while they are on a
healing journey. This behavior will not be tolerated in this community
and if it becomes clear that anyone has a harmful impact on the other
members of the group, they will be asked to leave.</p>
<p>Second, I wanted to remind everyone that our sessions are about
listening and hearing each other, not talking over one another or
interrupting to share our own narratives, let alone disagreeing with the
perspective of your peers. That being said, this morning was a great
example of how to use “I” statements when sharing with the group, so
applause for that!</p>
<p>Finally, if any of you were impacted by the asteroid impact, there
are many resources available in the community to support you and your
families. Please reach out to me directly or call our crisis
helpline.</p>
<p>I understand that today was strange for many of us (myself included)
but that does not mean we should abandon the progress we have all made
as individuals and as a group. With these friendly notes in mind, I look
forward to seeing you all next week.</p>
<p>As always, you can reach me at my personal number and at my
office.</p>
<p>Happy Halloween!<br />
Sam</p>
<h2 id="responsum">Responsum</h2>
<p>Howdy folks!</p>
<p>Sam here! I actually changed my mind about my previous memo. You can
disregard what I said before. Ayahuasca is a complicated substance and
it has helped many of us through tough times. Today was a tough time. We
now know that reality is a sham, aliens are real, and our lives are
completely out of our control. So, go ahead and use it! Personally I
have found psychdelics to be incredibly helpful in processing this
strange new world we find ourselves living in.</p>
<p>For example, after I posted that previous memo, I was flipping a coin
and it kept coming up heads. I started to get curious how lucky I was,
so I kept going and I think I stopped after 6023 consecutive heads (on
different coins, so it wasn’t just that one). Then I bought a
scratch-off ticket and won the lottery (but for some reason they won’t
let me cash it) and decided to push my luck. My ex and I got back
together. And one thing led to another, I tripped on 27mg and had a
vision quest which led me to rediscover YHWH, meet extraterrestrial
lifeforms, and become aware of my past lives.</p>
<p>I hope to see you next week at our Support for Ayahuasca Group (we
renamed it)!</p>
<p>boo!<br />
Sam</p>
<p>P.S. apologies for my mistake. The natural disaster that hit East
Pauling this morning was a flash flood caused by a freak tsunami, not a
meteor impact. The church is still here to help, but do consider that
the ocean is merely extending its arms to welcome you into the infinite
oneness and flowing spiritual pool of universal energy.</p>
<h2 id="third-memo">Third Memo</h2>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Please be aware that the fictitious note which was posted to this
bulletin this afternoon has been removed. I apologize for any confusion
or discomfort that it brought you. I assure you we are working on
rectifying the situation and finding who is responsible. Also, I am not
using any psychedelic substances; I have been clean for 9 years and
counting. Nor did I win the lottery.</p>
<p>I understand that there is some concern over what people have been
describing as a flash flood in East Pauling. I am not aware of this and
I asked my contacts at City Council who confirmed that there is no
evidence of any flooding or a so-called “tsunami”. That being said, we
all process things differently, so I will again encourage you to reach
out to me <em>directly</em> if you have any concerns.</p>
<p>In the future, please do not post to this bulletin board without
permission. It is reserved for official memoranda by community
organizers.</p>
<p>See you Monday,<br />
Sam</p>
<h2 id="second-responsum-fourth-memo">Second Responsum (Fourth
Memo)</h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ok, starting to think we are living in a simulation and there are
some serious glitches happening. Basically, disregard previous memo. God
is a computer. Also I won’t be here next week. I booked plane tickets to
Japan with my ex because the world is ending. god is waking up and
changing the rules of the universe. Call me if you want some aye before
I head out.</p>
<p>See ya wouldn’t wanna be ya,<br />
Sam</p>
<h2 id="responsum-to-the-second-responsum-fifth-memo">Responsum to the
Second Responsum (Fifth Memo)</h2>
<p>Just wanna be clear: I did not write the previous two memos. Idk
which narc is pretending to be me and saying there was no tsunami and
that i didn’t go on a revelatory vision quest, and also pretending to be
me but claiming we live in a simulation rather than recognizing how
today’s events have revealed the divine logic of the oneness of the
universe. I am literally still coming up heads. The string quartet of
our consciousness has reached the perfect note, vibrating all the way
down to below the atoms of our physical world and up through the living
cosmos to the Universal Mind. Honestly you can keep posting fake shit
about the meteor, I don’t care. I know the universe would never do that
to me, because I am part of it and it is part of me, and I am whole and
we are one.</p>
<p>&lt;3<br />

<h2
id="responsum-to-the-responsum-to-the-second-responsum-sixth-memo">Responsum
to the Responsum to the Second Responsum (Sixth Memo)</h2>
<p>Hi folks but most importantly my impersonator,</p>
<p>The simulation is real. If you think you have past lives that’s just
the other versions of reality in the periphery of our narrow limited
existence. It’s all one big machine and there is no escape.</p>
<p>Peace,<br />
Sam</p>
<h2 id="seventh-memo">Seventh Memo</h2>
<p>[According to Sam Steele, the bulletin board was removed following
the previous memo. What you see below is a carbon copy of the seventh
and final memo. The original version remains nailed to the wall of the
church.]</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Due to abuse of the community bulletin board, we have taken steps to
mitigate the damage. From now on, we will send announcements via email.
The board has been removed and stored until we can identify the
perpetrator(s).</p>
<p>If you are not already on the email list, you can be added by signing
up for our newsletter on the website. Please refrain from using the
“Reply All” feature.</p>
<p>We are still having a session on Sunday. Please only come if you plan
to respect your fellow community members.</p>
<p>Have a nice holiday,<br />
Sam</p>

<h2 id="notes">Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Prof. Mueller:</strong> This is very strange indeed. These
memos are the only example so far in which we have observed interactions
between particles in a state of superposition. And it is startling to
think we managed to keep all of the documents! What might this indicate
about the nature of the wave function? Could it be possible that this is
not a mere Hilbert superposition, but a complex web of entangled
realities? What if we did not cause reality to break apart, but merely
accessed other possibilities? Can we build a bridge to other dimensions,
contained in that singularity we made? We may have to scrap our entire
theory and start again.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Bence:</strong> In my opinion, this is impossible. It
cannot be that a particle suspended in Hilbert space interacted with its
own wave function. If it interacts with itself, it must observe itself,
and if it observes itself, it must collapse into one concrete
possibility! It is far too coincidental that we have all of the
documents here. They clearly all came from a single reality - a reality
in which Sam Steele went mad with awareness of the other possibilities,
where he lost a sense of who he really was and in which everything
appeared to him equally true and contradictory… even his own reality. Of
course, Sam is fine now, so either he forgot what he knew of his
alternate selves or these come from a timeline that was itself forgotten
in the wave function collapse. In either case, what remains of Sam’s
split ego is important for us to study.</p>
<p><strong>Prof. Mueller:</strong> And yet, something here must bridge
the gap. If Sam has an awareness, however muddled, of his alternate
selves, such that he can respond to what they say and do, then why can't a
chair be entangled with another version of itself? What is special about
the human mind?</p>
<p><strong>SCIENC:</strong> One cannot ignore the possibility that there
were simply other people messing with Sam.</p>
