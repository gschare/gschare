theme of nondeterminism as the center of all of this.
need to use hypertext somehow.
perhaps it's that every day there is a chance it stops being halloween, but it
doesn't. Until one day, it does.
ohhh and that's why all the times of notes are jumbled up - the day is repeated
over and over so people are trying all kinds of ways to tell time but there's a
nondeterministic path through time itself, so sometimes we go through old days
again. people _experience_ time nondeterministically, so each page is _written_
nondeterministically. yes, i think this is the idea.

Leaf (terminus) node - everything leads there. but it's available from the
start, but you "play" as the researcher who needs to piece everything together
like a puzzle. so you need to enter something in a form on the first page in
order to get access to the final link in the puzzle.

framing device: research project trying to piece together different events
so every page is a small vignette, labeled, pieces of media taken from various
places
